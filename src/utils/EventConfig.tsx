          S Agri Udaan, a Gujarat-based business, launched its first product in
          Banaskantha district&lsquo;s Tharad taluk. On 30/10/21, in the
          presence of honourable Mr. Parbat bhai patel, member of parliament
          (lok sabha), ex MLA of Gujarat-Tharad constituency, the launch took
          place in the farmhouse of Mr. Jivraj bhai patel, nagala village
          sarpanch.

          Drone is such an equipment with the help of which we can save time,
          water, money, and the health of the farmers as well as plants and our
          lands, said Mr. Parbat Bhai Patel. We can also save fertilisers
          because the amount of area wasted due to pesticide abuse would be
          small if drones were used. Today in Banaskantha district-tharad taluk,
          we are taking measures toward realising our PM Modi&lsquo;s ambition,
          he continues. S Agri Udaan has come here on their own; we fully
          support this company because we witnessed their drone launch and
          presentation. "The government is also supporting the use of drone
          technology," he says. "I personally ask our farmers to come forward
          and employ S Agri Udaan&lsquo;s services."

          S Agri Udaan has launched their first drone in nagala gaav,tharad
          district at my farmhouse, in the presence of mr parbat bhai patel,
          said mr. jivraj bhai patel. NANOUREA, a recently developed product in
          the market, necessitates several packets of urea in a tiny land area,
          resulting in product wastage, he continues. The use of urea on farming
          land reduces the fertility of the land. Because khedut (farmer) has a
          difficult time purchasing urea, the government has provided a subsidy.
          Khedut's concern is that this is an extremely labor-intensive
          operation because the urea particles are so minute that spraying them
          manually is difficult. More urea use, labour, and inappropriate urea
          spraying are causing harm to farmers' health, plant health, land
          yield, product waste, and unnecessary expense." Using drones to spray
          nano urea would be a revolutionary change for khrdut (farmers), he
          continues, "since it would be a lot more conservative and effective."

          S Agri Udaan is a step toward the development and expansion of our
          farmers, which has long been a desire of our honourable Prime
          Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. Shri Narendra Modi recently recommended
          and emphasised the benefits and advantages of drone technology on MAN
          KI BAAT. S Agri Udaan is one such company that is adamant on bridging
          the gap between farmers and technology by utilising drone technology
          in agriculture.

          Mr. Balendu Agnihotri, executive director of S Agri Udaan , stated
